Passcode Cracker Simulation
This program simulates a brute force attack against a 4-digit numeric passcode (0000-9999).

How It Works
System tries each code sequentially until the correct code is located.

Monitors the total attempts made and the duration taken.

Files
passcode_cracker.py: A python script.

output.txt: Example output for passcode “1234”.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

No external libraries needed
